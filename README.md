### Summary
The best model/model selected is LGBM with an accuracy of 81.09% and F1 score of 51% Decision Tree is underperforming (accuracy: 79.17%, f1 score: 50.50%). However, is easier to explain than LGBM.

Pitney and Bowes should specially keep an eye on the following meter features:

1. Charge Cycle time below 12
2. Discharging/Charging Rate by day 3
3. Discharging/Charging Rate
4. Number days in use
5. Number of times that meter restarts

### Problem Statement
Pintey Bowes must be proactive about identifying potential problems early on to avoid any sort of disruption for their client business.
### Goal
Building the models and predicting which meters will fail within the next 7 days and features caused the failure.
